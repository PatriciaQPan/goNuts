# Session 1 POIs descriptive analysis

## The minimum tasks we should accomplish are: 

### 1. Read the json file 
### 2. Unnest every column that is nested
### 3. Identify how many duplicates are in the data and remove them
### 4. Identify how many empty spaces are in the data and change them to NA's
### 5. Basic descriptive statistics for each column (Except descriptions)
### 6. Find out how many Parks or Museums are in the data (using descriptions)
### 7. In which country and city are more POIs 


## Nice to do (Extra)
### 8. Merge the external data (pois) with the internal data (pois_trivago)
### 9. Find out the distance between the external data and the internal data
